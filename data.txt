We received a request from Site Producer and they download data from Merch Portal
Site Producer will upload in Confluence Page
Developer Download File and start processing file
As part of processing we create 2 csv files, Subscription_MB and CHILD_MB_Subscription
We will create 2 seperate JIRA story and Attach each file on it
Once DIgital Commerce Team complete above JIRA story then we start validation for it.
We will validate each item against Bifrost Items Response to check ‘5% Promo’
Once we have validated all items then we will upload files in GCP bucket
In GCP Bucket we will upload data in 2 places one with 5% and one without 5%
After GCP Bucket validation, we will execute a ‘Product Batch Job’ to process above files
Once above Jobs is executed then we will send confirmation to product team for validation
