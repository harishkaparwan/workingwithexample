This error suggests a version mismatch between your Spring Boot Actuator and Micrometer Tracing libraries. Specifically, the method BraveBaggageManager.<init>(java.util.List) is missing, which indicates that the version of Micrometer Tracing you are using does not match the version expected by Spring Boot Actuator.

Steps to Resolve:
Check Your Dependencies:

Ensure that the versions of spring-boot-actuator and micrometer-tracing are compatible with each other.
For Spring Boot 3.3.0, ensure that you are using compatible versions of Micrometer Tracing.
Update Dependencies:

If you are using Maven, you can adjust your pom.xml to ensure that the versions are aligned. For example:
xml
Copy code
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-actuator</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.3</version>
</dependency>
Check the official documentation or release notes to find compatible versions of these libraries.
Exclude Conflicting Versions:

If you have transitive dependencies that bring in conflicting versions, you may need to exclude them:
xml
Copy code
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-actuator-autoconfigure</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
            <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
Force a Specific Version:

Sometimes, forcing a specific version across your project can resolve these kinds of issues:
xml
Copy code
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
            <artifactId>micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave</artifactId>
            <version>1.1.3</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
Clean and Rebuild:

After making changes, clean your project and rebuild it to ensure no old classes are being referenced.
By ensuring that your dependencies are aligned, this issue should be resolved.
